# Fully-Pipelined-Edge-Detector-Algorithms-Using-VHDL
Roberts, Prewitt, Scharr, and Sobel edge detector algorithms <br/>

The core includes Roberts, Prewitt, Scharr, and Sobel edge detector algorithms. The design is fully pipelined. The latency is 5. After 5 clocks, it produces output at each clock. The desisn is generic as well. You can use the edge detector in the top module. Only the hardware of edge detector algorithm you choose is generated. <br/>

My design is published at opencores.org as well. <br/>
